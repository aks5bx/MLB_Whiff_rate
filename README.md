# MLB Whiff Probability Analysis

The prompt for this project is as follows: 

Towards the end of the 2020 season, Pitcher X approached one of our coaches and said that his goal in 2021 was to maximize the amount of swing-and-miss that he generates on a per-pitch basis. The coach has asked you to provide recommended data-driven strategies that Pitcher X can pursue to optimize his whiff rates, given his body of work from the last two seasons.

You have been provided with 2019-20 data of Pitcher X’s pitch-by-pitch performance. We’ve created a column whiff_prob for you that is the probability that the given pitch will result in a swing-and-miss based on its velocity, movement, location, and release. Based on the data provided, identify strategies that Pitcher X can employ to maximize whiff probability moving forward.

In order to tackle this project, I used machine learning modeling and simulation testing in order to: 

1) Determine the factors that were most impactful in influencing the movement of Whiff Probability 

2) Understand how exactly those factors influence Whiff Probability 

3) Quantify how optimizing these factors might improve Whiff Probability
